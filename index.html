		<h5>The document below is the project that I did with my groupmates for business idea for "Finding YOU". The idea of the app is to improve the comfortability of IU Mobile and make it easier to navigate it for a first time user. It asks the user to input information about their interests and experiences in the past. By collection this data, the program outputs various clubs and other organizations they can join to. </h5>
